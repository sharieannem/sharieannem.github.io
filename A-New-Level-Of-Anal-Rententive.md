## What I First Thought About Programming

The first time I looked at a line of code was when I was nine or ten years old. I was trying to learn basic HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)â€”two of many programming languages used for web development. I was a very confused little kid trying to understand the meaning of each line of code; experimenting by deleting one line to see how it would affect the overall outcome of the design... and then reverting back to how the code used to be because the design of the page ended up broken somehow (hmmm... I wonder why..). I bring this memory up because despite the hours of looking at a screen and trying to learn by manipulating the code, I actually found it somewhat easy to read and understand each line of code and what it is trying to do because of how the code was structured. For example, in CSS, my "kiddy" mind understood that the brackets signified the start and end of a declaration block. And everything in between were declarations seperated by a semicolon. I would not have come to a realization if the code itself was not spaced and indented properly like the image above. It would have been way too much for my mind to process and prevented me from delving in much further.

## Moving On To My First Programming Course

I took my first programming class in Leeward Community College (LCC) at Pearl City, Oahu.

## Conclusion

All in all, coding standards is a way-to-go when it comes to creating programs that are shared in large groups, easy debugging of a program for errors, etc.
