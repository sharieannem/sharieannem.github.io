## My Experiences

There are those times where we stumble on a difficult problem and it leads us to become impatient because our minds do not know how to approach it. After indulging in it for a couple of seconds...minutes...or even hours, it can be very tiring and irritating to realize that in the end, you still do not know how to solve a specific problem. As a college student taking on Computer Science as a major, this happens to me a couple of times a week. But asking questions, more importantly, asking questions the "Smart" way can lead to rewarding answers and a great understanding of how to approach your specific problem.

## What is "smart"?

First of all, when asking questions, it is very important to know what you want and lay down what you know. It can be extremely easy to just throw a bunch of questions at someone whom you think has all the answers for your problems but it is most likely inefficient to do so and is seen as very bothersome to most as it shows your incapability to communicate your questions/problems in a professional and concise way. It also shows that you are more focused on getting it done rather than the quality of understanding the concepts and possibly applying it to other similar questions/problems. 
Therefore, as an example, I browsed the various questions stored in StackOverflow and stumbled on a questions that is delivered appropriatly to the forum community. 
The question is given below:
"How do you create a remote Git branch? I created a local branch which I want to 'push' upstream. There is a similar question here on Stack Overflow on how to track a newly created remote branch. However, my workflow is slightly different. First I want to create a local branch, and I will only push it upstream when I'm satisfied and want to share my branch.
How would I do that? (my google searches did not seem to come up with anything).
How would I tell my colleagues to pull it from the upstream repository?

UPDATE With Git 2.0 there is a simpler answer I have written below: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27185855/109305"

As you can see here, this post is not just one line asking for help. Instead it clearly demonstrates the user's attempts on finding solutions on his/her own and it clearly states what he/she is trying to do. As a result for its quality, this question got thousands of positive feedback and responses.

## What is "not smart"?

Questions opposite to the example above are more likely to yield the opposite results or no results at all. Questions that are told in a "not smart" fashion tend to sound like the user is desperate for the answer only and/or demonstrate the user's lack of research on his/her own question. These questions can be very ambiguous as it might not clearly state what the goal is in a concise and professional manner.
