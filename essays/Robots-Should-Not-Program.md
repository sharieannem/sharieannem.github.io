## What are software engineering ethics?

## Major Dislike

One aspect about running Meteor from my Windows 10 8GGB RAM computer was the load time. Installing and running meteor for a project took me about 10 minutes if I was lucky. If I was not lucky, let's just say it was faster to update my application than the sum time it took for Meteor to get up and running.

## A Few "Crashes"

Being that Meteor was the first full-stack web application framework that I have worked with, I stumbled on a few things. For one, learning about Meteor's application structure ws a bit overwhelming because it seemed very complex than what I was used to. Meteor applications are structured in a way where there are subdirectories specific for the client, for the server, and for the imports. And within those, can be other subdirectories as well. Another difficulty I found was incorporating MongoDB's templates and collections into my application.

## Easy

I found most of my journey with Meteor to be extremely difficult and long but what made it a bit easier was my background in CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Meteor integrates these languages, uses additional plugins, and is equpped with MongoDb. FlowRouter for one was also a great tool to use because it made routing between different pages definitely easier.

## Requirements
Now write an interesting, informative technical essay about ethics in software engineering. You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
