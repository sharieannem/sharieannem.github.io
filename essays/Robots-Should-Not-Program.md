## What are software engineering ethics?

In my opinion, I think ethics regarding software engineering is extremely important. Code that a programmer generates is a small representation of that programmer's ethical standards. Integrity, respect, and honesty are three synonymous words but they all fall under what it means to be ethically competent. A programmer without ethics is one who is just doing the job, no matter what it is and who it will effect. I call this type of programmer a robot. What a dangerous analogy, but I believe it to be true. For one, robots do not possess the ability to reason, sympathize, rationalize, and make complex moral decisions like humans. This reason alone makes humans unique from all other species on Earth. Software are very powerful and can affect many people, whether good or bad. Programmers may just be behind a computer but writing code is more than just using the correct algorithms/problem-solving methods to fulfill a task. Instead, it is more like a civil duty to oneself and to others because of how powerful this type of platform can be.

## Ethical Scenario

An example of this civil duty is portrayed in this scenario:

## A Few "Crashes"

Being that Meteor was the first full-stack web application framework that I have worked with, I stumbled on a few things. For one, learning about Meteor's application structure ws a bit overwhelming because it seemed very complex than what I was used to. Meteor applications are structured in a way where there are subdirectories specific for the client, for the server, and for the imports. And within those, can be other subdirectories as well. Another difficulty I found was incorporating MongoDB's templates and collections into my application.

## Easy

I found most of my journey with Meteor to be extremely difficult and long but what made it a bit easier was my background in CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Meteor integrates these languages, uses additional plugins, and is equpped with MongoDb. FlowRouter for one was also a great tool to use because it made routing between different pages definitely easier.

## Conclusion

Programmers are equipped with their own set of ethics.


## Requirements
 Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
