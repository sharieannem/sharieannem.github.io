## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)

<b>The Problem:</b> Before each semester, UHM students go through the time-consuming process of scheduling advising appointments with their respective department advisors, deciding which classes to take, of those classes deciding which professor to take, and ultimately deciding how all those classes will fit in their semester schedule in a desirable and optimized way. Sometimes problems (such as having to let go of a class because it cant fit into their schedule and thus resulting to falling behind in their degree plan) can arise where students are not able to find an optimized schedule that fits all their needs because of well, human error.

<b>Solution:</b> The Optimized Schedule is an application for UHM students that will allow them to choose between different possible schedules that are best fit for the classes they need for a specific semester. The student will have to provide which classes they need. The app will then pull data from the STAR database that includes different class times and days for each course and the professor for those courses. In the end, the student will be given a list of possible schedules to choose from for their upcoming semester. Depending on the courses available from the STAR database, the student will either be given an array of results or none at all. Regardless, the app's goal is to find an optimized schedule for the student.

##Mockup page ideas

-Public landing page
-Login page
-User home page
-Admin home page
-User profile
-Final Schedule List page
-Input courses page

##Use case ideas

-New user goes to public landing, log in, home page,and profile pages
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for item, sets up notification.
User logs in, updates parameters, views possible schedules.
User tries delete, edit schedules.
User and admin interact to ban inappropriate usage.

##Beyond the basics
After the basic pages that give the general usage of the web applciation, here are some features to make the app more enhanced:
-Auto updating based on class availability
