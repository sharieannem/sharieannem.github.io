'A Glimpse in Realistic Art' is what I call my first, professional, realistic art piece. This project was completed as part of the requirements for my Introduction to Art class during my junior year of high school. 

The goal in creating this piece was to capture the aspects of light, shade, dimension, proportion, and realism of a portion of my face using real-time observations in front of a mirror. Using the techniques I learned in class and the variety of lead pencils (i.e. 2B, 4B, H, 4H) provided for me, I created a drawing of my nose and mouth in a period of less than two weeks.

From this experience, I had the opportunity to exercise the artistic side of me. At that time, my artistic qualities were very minimal and emphasis towards it was put to the side to focus on other technical things related to what I wanted to do with my future (i.e. math, science, and computer classes). But by completing this piece, I realized that art can be used to strengthen creative-thinking, which I think is necessary in solving and working through certain problems in Computer Science.
