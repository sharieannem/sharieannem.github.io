[Kirby](https://github.com/sharieannem/kirby) is a interactive java game that I developed with a partner as part of my final project in ICS 111. In the beginning, it counts down from 10 and displays the controls/rules of the game. There are three levels where each level gets progressively harder in difficulty in terms of how much time the player is given. To win the game, the player must navigate Kirby left and right so that he can "swallow" five falling objects in order to gain the five required points to advance to the next level. To make it challenging, there are also other falling objects (spikes) that would lead to a deduction of one point if Kirby touches them.

For this project, my partner and I worked together to decide on the specifications and details of the game. We divided the classes needed (i.e. main class, objects class, etc.) evenly and gave input in each other's resulting code.

At first when I was beginning to learn the language, I did not know the advance applications that Java could be used for. Going through the process in programming my very first game, I learned a lot about the capabilities of what Java has to offer. It gave me an insight on how programming languages are used in everyday applications and entertainment. This point in my education had inspired me to become more explorative in learning about different programming languages.
